This is an initial version.  

This is a simple tool that extracts the known metadata of wave audio files embeded by autonomous recording units (ARU), 
used commonly in bioacoustic research.
Supported ARUs:
AudioMoth: the metadata is included in the ARTIST0 and COMMENT tags.
GUANO metadata (Grand Unified Acoustic Notation Ontology, see https://github.com/riggsd/guano-spec): all the metadata is extracted

The software was tested with files recorded by AudioMoths (v1.2) and Song Meters Mini.
